 In today's fast-paced world, restaurant owners and managers are constantly seeking ways to
 streamline their operations and provide their customers with a better dining experience. A restaurant
 management system (RMS) is an all-in-one solution that can help restaurants manage various aspects
 of their business, including menu management, order processing, inventory management, customer
 management, and more. In this section, we will discuss the requirements and functionalities of an
 RMSandwhyit is needed.
 
 Storyline:
 Imagine a popular restaurant that is always busy with customers. The restaurant has a team of
 hardworking staff members who take orders, prepare food, and serve customers. However, the
 restaurant owner realizes that their current system of managing orders, inventory, and customer data is
 inefficient and time-consuming. The staff often struggle to keep up with the high volume of orders,
 and customers complain about long wait times and errors in their orders. In addition, the owner has
 difficulty keeping track of inventory and analyzing sales data to make informed decisions about menu
offerings.
 To address these challenges, the restaurant owner decides to implement a restaurant management
 system that can automate many of the manual tasks and provide a better overall experience for both
 customers and staff.
 
 Requirements:
 An RMSshould have the following key requirements:
 1) Order Management: The system should be able to take orders from multiple channels (such as
 online, phone, and in-person) and manage them efficiently. It should provide real-time updates
 on order status and enable staff to manage orders quickly and accurately.
 2) Menu Management: The system should allow restaurant managers to create and update menus
 easily. It should support different types of menus (such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and
 enable managers to add or remove items as needed.
 3) Inventory Management: The system should help restaurant managers track inventory levels and
 manage stock efficiently. It should provide alerts when stock levels are low and enable
 managers to reorder items automatically.
 4) Customer Management: The system should enable restaurant managers to store and manage 4
 customer data, including contact information, order history, and feedback. It should allow
 managers to analyze customer data and make informed decisions about marketing and menu
 offerings.

 Functionalities:
 An RMSshould provide the following functionalities to meet the requirements mentioned above:
 Here are some features of our website:

 encouraging them to come back and order more frequently.
6) Customer feedback: The website can offer customers the ability to leave feedback on their
 orders, helping the restaurant to improve their offerings and service.
